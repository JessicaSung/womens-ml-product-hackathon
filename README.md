# Women's Machine Learning as a Product Hackathon and Bootcamp

Welcome to the repo for the hackathon and bootcamp hosted by [Expero](https://experoinc.com). Thanks for participating!

## Bootcamp

We hope you can make it to the bootcamp on Friday, the 27th. Please check out the [bootcamp](bootcamp/) folder for more information on subjects we'll cover and tools you should bring with you.

## Hackathon

We've prepared some sample [projects](link_missing) and curated some open source [data](data/) for you to look through. Please don't feel limited to these meager options; the best projects are built from domain expertise and assets you already possess.
