# Intro to Machine Learning Bootcamp

The following material will be taught in Python by Dr. Graham Ganssle from 9 am - 11:30 am, and then in R by Caitlin Hudon from 12:30 pm - 2:30 pm. Please feel free to skip one of those sessions if it doesn't interest you, but if you're feeling adventurous, it'll be interesting to cover the same concepts in two different languages; it's a great way to become agnostic to the tools, and instead learn the underlying concepts more deeply.

## Curriculum

* Linear Regression
  * Of a single variable
  * Multivariate


* Logistic regression
  * Intro to classification
  * Classification by logistic regression


* Trees
  * A single decision tree
    * hard coded
    * machine learning
  * A forest of trees: random forest classifiers


* Unsupervised learning
  * Kmeans
  * DBSCAN
  * PCA


* [stretch goal] Neural Networks
  * NNs using Pytorch

## Required Dependencies

Since the time allotted is so short we ask that you come prepared with the following required dependencies installed, running, and tested on your machine:
